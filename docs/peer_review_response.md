Anthony Huang Code Review
- ✅ The route /admin/admin/delete is repeated. The second “admin” in the path isn’t needed.
- ✅ The add_friends route is still using GET even though it sends data. This should be POST.
- ✅ The get_recent_games route is a POST request, but it only gets data. It should be a GET.
- ✅ The search_games route should also be a GET instead of POST.
- ✅ The get_reviews_for_games route uses POST when it should be GET.
- ✅ The path /games/games/ is confusing. Remove the extra “games” so it’s just /games/.
- ✅ /user/{user_id}/history uses GET, but make sure it only needs the user_id(or username?)from the path and not a request body.
  - deleted request body
- ✅ Same with /user/{user_id}/favorite. GET is fine as long as no body is used.
  - deleted request body
- ✅ The edit and publish review routes are using POST, but they should use PATCH for updates.
- ✅ The edit/optional route should probably use PATCH too instead of POST.
- ✅ You can combine the optional review edit and create into one function that adds or updates depending on if it already exists.
  - did just as recommended
- ✅ Some routes like /reviews/{review_id}/comments could benefit from a GET version to view comments, not just POST.
  - added get comments

Anthony Huang Schema/API Design
- ❌ The settings table uses both id and user_id as primary keys. That can cause problems, it should just use one.
    - id is supposed to be id for setting
- ✅ The User model is used in routes where only user_id is needed. It would be easier to just pass the ID.
  - removed User model
- ❌ The friends table only tracks one-way friendships. If users are supposed to be real friends, this should be two-way.
    - its more like a follow system
- ... It’s not clear if a review can have more than one optional review. The design could explain that better.
- ✅ There’s no endpoint to get the list of genres, even though each game has a genre ID. A /genres route would help.
  - added get_genres and add genre
- ✅ Comments don’t return the commenter’s username. That makes it harder to display who said what.
  - added usernames
- ✅ Most list endpoints don’t have a way to limit results. Adding limit and skip options would help.
  - added limit options to some endpoints
- ✅ Some routes that only get data (like search) use POST instead of GET.
- ✅ There’s no clear error message format. It would be better to return errors in a standard way.
  - added error checking for existence
- ✅ Some route names are repetitive, like /games/games/. These can be shortened.
- ✅ Fields like text, description, and review_name are used in different places but mean similar things. Try to use the same names.
  - changed all instances of description to text, review_name means something else
- ✅ Some endpoints return raw lists of data. It might be better to wrap them in a response object for easier parsing on the frontend.
  - created response objects

Anna Grillo Code Review
- ✅ add comments to recomendation algorithm - about how decisions are being made/why you chose 1.2 and 1.1 as the starting values
- ✅ popular_recomendations, could do less work in the api call, make a helper function
  - made a get game info function after getting games recommended
- ✅ in display friends, can add another join on users to avoid the for loop where you get the user's id
- ✅ "ORDER BY last_played" in popular_recomendations should possibly be desc, instead of getting the first 10 games they played
- ✅ "ORDER BY time_played" in popular_recomendations should possibly be desc, instead of getting the first 10 games they played
- ❌ the interval for recommendations should be more consistent, in one query you limit 10, in another you take the last 30 days, limiting friend and user reviews by 3
  - Am finding recently reviewed games and limiting that to 10, not really being inconsistent. Limiting reviews by 3 is because a game can possibly display up to 20 reviews total, maybe too much.
- ❌ can avoid this for loop " for game in games_list:" by grabbing info about the game as you pick it out from top_games and friend_games
  - I think it is ok. When i get it from the top_games and friend_games I will have to store all the review infos somewhere. Also it is not guranteed top_games and friend_games makes it to the recommendations. 
- ✅ in general should avoid for loops in db calls
  - put loops outside of db calls when possible
- ✅ in users.py, it doesn't look like you have a need for User class, all you ever use from that is the user_id or user_id of the friend
  - deleted User
- ✅ admin delete returns false no matter what
- ❌ games/search might through in error if it returns nothing from the query
  - it will return an empty list, so it should be fine
- ✅ Add_friends should be POST 

Anna Grillo Schema/API Design
- ✅ There should be a way for users to see who has added them that they are not friends with yet, currently you only have display list of friends
  - added get people that added user function
- ✅ maybe display optional reviews in the feed or in history, currently no way to see those reviews
  - included in feed
- ✅ should add more information about the game into the games table, ex. multiplayer, platform (console or pc or both), version
  - added multiplayer and platform, i think adding version is not that necessary
- ✅ not sure what “value” in the settings table is used for, should make this more clear if it’s to tell if a user is private or public - but not sure what that even changes for the user
  - yeah we don't use it, we will remove it
- ✅ no GET endpoints should have a request body, fix that to be using the path parameters
  - removed request bodies
- ✅ /feed/ returns a 500 internal server error
- ❌ id is not set to the primary key in users
  - it is
